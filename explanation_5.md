Using LinkedList structure for the blockchain gives use the advantage of accessing the head in constant time

The time complexity here is O(1) since we just have to check the head of the blockchain

The block class consists of 4 properties that contain strings. Assuming the size of the strings to be n, the space complexity of a block is therefore O(4n) => O(n)
