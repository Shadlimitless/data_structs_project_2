I am using set to collect the unique elements in both linked lists for both the union and intersection functions
For both functions, I decided to loop through each list independently so as not to double the time complexity by nesting which is also possible
The time efficiency for this code is O(n) due to the loops that are directly affected by the size of the inputs
